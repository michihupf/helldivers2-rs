# Helldivers 2 API wrapper in Rust
This is a wrapper around the [Helldivers 2 API]("https://github.com/helldivers-2/api")
provided by the [Helldivers 2 Community](https://github.com/helldivers-2) community implemented 
in the Rust programming language.

# Documentation and Project Layout
The project significantly lacks extensive documentation as it is still in early development.
The first major version will include extensive documentation and code examples.

Early development will continue on branch `master` until the first major version. From there 
further development will be done on `next` and `dev` before being remerged to `master`.

# Disclaimer
This project does not wrap the official Helldivers 2 API. Additionally, this project is a work in
progress and will undergo some more changes before it will be usable.

Also, this is my first Open Source Rust project and my first API wrapper. I am open to suggestions, tips 
and pull requests for improving readability, code layout and overall performance.

# Future
I intend to also wrap the [HellHub Collective API](https://github.com/hellhub-collective/api) in the near future.
